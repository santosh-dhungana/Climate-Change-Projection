# Cliamte-Change-Projection

These scripts houses codes to linearly bias-correct precipitation and temperature of the Tonlesap Basin in Cambodia. It directly processess the netcdf file to produce bias corrected CMIP6 climate models. ERA-5 temperature data set is used as reference dataset. Prior to bias correction, GCM models were spatially regridded to ERA-5 dataset spatial resolution.
